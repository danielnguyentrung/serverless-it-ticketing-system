# Serverless It Ticketing System
A serverless IT Ticketing system built on AWS leveraging Amazon S3, API Gateway, SQS, Lambda, SNS, and SES for scalable request handling and notifications.

## Problem & Motivation

Many IT Teams spend a significant amount of time performing manual tasks. These include reviewing the content of each ticket to understand problem specifications and urgency, 
handling vague or incomplete ticket submissions, following up with users for missing information, and dealing with systems that are not providing concise ticket information. 

## Solution Overview

To address these challenges, I implemented a fully serverless IT ticketing system on AWS. The system automates ticket validation, prioritization, notifications, and duplicate detection, helping the IT team focus on resolving issues rather than manually managing tickets, while improving overall response times and reliability.
